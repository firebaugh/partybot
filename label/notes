TO DO:
- graph of segments scores
- local hill climbing - for each individual after crossover mutation, slide back and forth with max times and pick best
- batch script
- distribute

- LATER (ICA?): cross over source song, beat match to mashup (since we have that power :D)

EVALUATION (oblative study of GA):
- try ranking vs. sigma scaling
- try with multiple mutation rates/cross over rates
- 10 diff runs of GA
- SMOOTH with exponentially weighted average:
    avg_t = alpha*avg_t-1 + (1-alpha)*x_t
