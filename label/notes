TO DO:
- reconstruction
- visualize population (fitness and type in case of duplicates)
- cross over source song, beat match to mashup (since we have that power :D)
- local hill climbing
- batch script
- distribute

QUESTIONS:
- use sigma scaling then weighted random choice?
- choose mate population of population size?
- choose distinct mates?
- repair duplicate children?
- normalize with sigma scaling?
- maximize fitness when fitness = 1 - feature distance
- crossover rate?
- re-randomize unsustainable individuals with same # of transitions?
- add next pop to curr pop and select top based on *unscaled* fitness?
