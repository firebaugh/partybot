== Mashup.py ==

Created by Caitlyn Clabaugh

Mashup.py uses Smith-Waterman sequence alignment OR a Genetic Algorithm to align a given music mashup with its N given source songs. The alignment scoring is based on the euclidean distance between segments' timbre and pitch features. All data is stored in a graph described below. Timbre and pitch analysis is taken from earworm.py, which uses the EchoNest Remix API.

GRAPH.nodes(data=True): list of nodes by time
     NODE: tuple of index and feature dictionary
        INDEX: integer
        DICT: key = name of feature, value = any type
             'timbre': array of 12 float32
             'pitch': array of 12 float32
             'label': tuple of source song name and float32 for source song index
 
GRAPH.edges(data=True):
    EDGE: tuple (from_node_index, to_node_index)
       
== Libraries ==

The following libraries must be installed:
    - Echo Nest Remix
    - networkx
    - numpy

== Usage ==

Usage: Mashup.py [options] <path_to_mashup> [<path_to_source1> <path_to_source2> ...]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         show results on screen
  -f, --force           force recompute graph
  -l ALGO, --label=ALGO label mashup using ALGO: "SA" for sequence alignment 
                        or "GA" for genetic algorithm
  -r, --render          reconstruct mashup using source songs
  -p PLOT, --plot=PLOT  plot GA's progress to .dat file PLOT
  -s SIZE, --size=SIZE  SIZE of GA population
  -g GENS, --maxgens=GENS
                        max number of GENS for GA to run
  -c CROSSOVER, --crossover=CROSSOVER
                        crossover rate for GA
  -m MUTATION, --mutation=MUTATION
                        mutation rate for GA
  -o OPTIMUM, --optimum=OPTIMUM
                        optimum for GA

== Shell Script ==

!! UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!

To label multiple mashups, create a directory structure described below for your mashups and their respective source songs, then run ./label_script and enter path to mashup directory.

== Future Work ==

- Batch labeling script
- Better GA labeling
